# Getting started with CloudForms in IBM Cloud
{: #getting-started}

CloudForms delivers the insight, control, and automation enterprises need to address the challenges of managing virtual environments. CloudForms enables enterprises with existing virtual infrastructures to improve visibility and control, and those just starting virtualization deployments to build and operate a well-managed virtual infrastructure. For more details, see the [CloudForms product documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0/).
You can install CloudForms as a virtual appliance running in IBM Cloud.

## Before you begin

- Before you can install CloudForms, you must download the images from [IBM Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/index.html). Download these installation images:

| Description                                                                      | File name                               | Passport Advantage part number |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Red Hat CloudForms 5 for Red Hat OpenStack Platform | cfme-rhos-5.11.4.x86_64.qcow2 |   CC5W9EN  |
| Automation navigation for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_pak_mcm}} 1.3 | automation-navigation-updates.sh | CC66KEN  |
|

- For the list of all part numbers, see [Passport Advantage part numbers](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFC4F_1.3.0/about/part_numbers.html).  
- You must have an IBM Cloud user account with the following roles: 
![image](images/required_roles.png)

- You must have installed {{site.data.keyword.cp4mcm_full_notm}}. For details, see: [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.cp4mcm_full_notm}}](getting-started.md)  


## Step A. Setting up the Custom image for CloudForms in IBM Cloud
{: #config-image}
Create a custom Linux-based image to deploy CloudForms as a virtual server instance in the IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure.

1. If you don't already have an instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage, see [Getting started with IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started)

    Example Cloud Object Storage created:
    ![image](images/cloud_object_storage.png)

    You must also create a bucket in IBM Cloud Object Storage to store your images.
    Example Standard type bucket created:
    ![image](images/buckets.png)

2. Upload the CloudForms installation images to your IBM Cloud Object Storage.  Navigate to your bucket and click Add Objects to upload the images. For more details, see: [Uploading data using the console](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload#upload-console). **Note:** You can use the Aspera high-speed transfer plug-in to upload images larger than 200 MB.  
Example using Aspera uploaded file to bucket:
![image](images/upload_images_to_bucket.png)

3. From IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM), create an authorization between the VPC Infrastructure (source service) > Image Service for VPC (resource type) and Cloud Object Storage (target service). For details, see: [Create an authorization](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-serviceauth#serviceauth).
    
    **Important**: The configuration must be set up as this example or permissions will not work. 
    ![image](images/service_auth_vpc.png)

4. 1qaCreate a second-generation VPC (Must be 2nd generation). For more details, see: [Create a VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started#create-and-configure-vpc)

1) Create a VPC - The VPC must be in the same resource group and region as your bucket.
2) Create subnets in one or more zones. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges or in your own IP ranges that you bring to IBM Cloud.
3) Attach a public gateway if you want to allow all resources in a subnet to communicate with the public internet.
Result:
![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/3ee84780-79ab-11ea-8be7-897ea38e599d)

4) Configure an access control list (ACL) to limit the subnet's inbound and outbound traffic.
Will need to open ports:
Result:  (Need to harden this)
![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/b918cc00-79ab-11ea-8198-0e09b7f25974)

5) Import image from bucket into VPC
From the custom image tab under the result list:
select the import custom image button:

a) input a name
b) select a resource group
c) select region 
![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/95f01b80-79af-11ea-95f0-142b552f0482)
d) select your COS and bucket based on your authentication in step 3.
e) select your qcow 2 image
f) select the Red Hat operating system
![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/22024300-79b0-11ea-97cc-f336d833d98e)
g) select import custom image 

Result:
![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/bf5d7700-79b0-11ea-9fb0-d3350dfd2fba)

6 ) Create a virtual server from the custom image by selecting "create virtual server"
a) input your name
b) select your region
c) select the Red Hat operating system
d) Recommend Memory Profile ( 2 vcpus, 16 gb ram, 4gps)
e) Add a ssh key - Use a public key.
![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/71557b80-7a63-11ea-874d-6d3338717fda)
f) Add storage to your virtual service. 100 gig recommended. This volume is needed to configure the appliance. 

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/30119b80-7a64-11ea-867b-87cccd3bf956)

g) Select create virtual server instance. 
 
7) Update the security group that allows inbound and outbound traffic. (Need to harden this -ie 443, 5341...)
Result:
![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/1ca2f980-79ac-11ea-9217-168953ad1bee)

8) Assign floating ip:

final result: 
![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/26c7f680-79b2-11ea-8877-1861d1c14f75)


B) Setting up the appliance:

1) ssh into your appliance by using the floating ip:

2) Configure the appliance: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0/html/installing_cloudforms_on_red_hat_enterprise_virtualization/configuring-cloudforms

![image](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/4856/files/b7530680-79b3-11ea-86e5-909d83ff18a0)

- networking is already configured skip this step:
- Install the internal database;  region; volume attachment should be automatically found
- stop and start the evm
- type url (https://floatingip) in browser. 

C) Configure CloudPak  with CloudForms
[Integrating CloudForms with IBM Cloud Pakâ„¢ console ](https://www-03preprod.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFC4F_1.3.0/install/cloudforms.html)

1) Run the following script * need a place for it
chmod 755 ./automation-navigation-updates.sh
./automation-navigation-updates.sh -c <CloudForms URL> 

Results:
